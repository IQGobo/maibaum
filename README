Maibaum - show some love
========================

This one file website paints a new tree in front of a sunny sky with some clouds. 
Not sure about your local tradition, but in germany you setup such trees for the girl you love during the night to the first of may. Being a nerd, you better not leave your cosy basement and expose yourself to some wildlife environment but instead show your love binary.

Tips
====
- Include your very own love oath by suffixing a local anchor tag to your URL (just add "#you+her" after the index.html).
- if you click the canvas (the generated picture of the tree and everything) to open that as an image to be able to save it to disk
